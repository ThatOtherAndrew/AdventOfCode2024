# Andrew's Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

## What is this?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an **annual advent calendar of programming challenges**, and a fun way to keep your programmer brain sharp or get a bit of competitive programming practice! It's **free for all** to participate in (and all past problems are always accessible!) so I'd strongly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.

However, if you're reading this, chances are you likely know what Advent of Code is already!

## How do I use these solutions?

You can either browse the source files directly through GitHub, or clone the repository for an interactive copy (recommended):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/AdventOfCode2024.git
```

Solutions were developed and run using [CPython 3.12.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3126/) - results may vary with other versions. I'd recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python runtimes.

If you want to run them yourself, just run the Python files in the respective directories for each day's solutions. You may notice the glaring omission of input files and possibly bump into corresponding file not found errors - this is because the creator of Advent of Code asks that we [don't share or distribute puzzle inputs](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e7khy8/comment/fa13hb9/). You'll therefore have to provide these yourself in an `input.txt` file in each directory. Sorry! (Alternatively, you could make a simple source edit to use one of the sample files instead.)

Also, I shouldn't have to say this, but pleasepleaseplease don't just use these solutions to compute your personalised answers! You're only cheating yourself, unless you're on a private leaderboard with others, in which case it's just an icky thing to do. It's an exercise for your brain, not your computer's CPU, after all!
